Hi! I'm **Nicholas Lin** or **@Braregorn** and I'm interested in exploring software development, machine learning, and data science.

I'm currently pursuing a joint major in Computer Science and Data Science at New York University, attempting to master Java, C++, and SQL, as well as
trying to find the best poke restaurant in NYC.

You can reach me by email at *nl1637@nyu.edu* or by my mobile at *(856)-278-5101*
